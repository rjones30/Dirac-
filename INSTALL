This document is intended as a quick-start guide for building and using the
Dirac++ library for computing scattering cross sections.

1) Check out the latest source from github.

   $ git clone https://github.com/rjones30/Diracxx.git
   
2) Download and install the ROOT package from root.cern.ch version 6
   or greater.

3) Build the Dirac++ library.
   Cmake version 3 is required to build the Dirac++ library from sources.

   $ cd Diracxx
   $ mkdir build
   $ cd build
   $ cmake3 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<your_installation_area> \
           [ other cmake option ] \
           ..
   $ cmake3 --build .
   $ cmake3 --install .

4) Some example Dirac++ calculators are included in the directory
   rootmacros. The following commands illustrate how to run the
   examples within the root application.
   $ root -l
   root [0] .L <your_installation_area>/x86_64/lib/libDirac.so
   root [1] .L <your_installation_area>/x86_64/rootmacros/test.C++
   root [2] TestFourVectorComplex()
   root [3] TestPauliMatrix()
   root [4] ... run more tests ...

5) The rootmacros directory contains examples of root applications for
   common QED processes like Compton scattering, bremsstrahlung, and
   pair production on atomic targets. Load the examples within a root
   session as illustrated above, and plot the results.
